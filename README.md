**1. Project Setup**

First, you'll need to install Laravel. Ensure you have Composer installed on your system, then create a new Laravel project:

**composer install**

**2. Environment Setup**

Configure your .env file with appropriate database credentials:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql

DB_HOST=127.0.0.1

DB_PORT=3306

DB_DATABASE=ride_hailing

DB_USERNAME=root

DB_PASSWORD=

**3. Authentication**
Set up authentication using Laravel Breeze for simple authentication:

composer require laravel/breeze --dev

php artisan breeze:install

npm install && npm run dev

php artisan migrate
Sure, I understand you want a complete `README.md` file for your GitHub project, which includes detailed setup instructions and images. Here is the full content:
